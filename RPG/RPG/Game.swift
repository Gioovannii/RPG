                                Fighting Game

         Hey man, you have been catch by the troops of Roma. But we are lucky they
    choice you as our captain. By chance I've already check our possible teams.
    Check this out :
         
        + Warrior with 100 life points and equiped with a Sword of 10 dammage
        + Magus with 60 life points with a Magic stick of 30 healing but unable to attack
        + Colossus with 150 life points with a Spiked Shield of 3 dammage

    You can choice 3 characters maximum until someone have all his characters dead
   To have a good start we gave to all characters a magic drink of 20 life points.

    Maybe you get a chance to find a new Weapon who knows ...

            Good luck to you
